## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: Ability to explain complex technical concepts in accessible language; pedagogical clarity and simplification skills
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Reading comprehension and summarization capabilities; ability to extract and condense key information
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative writing and storytelling ability; imagination and narrative coherence within constraints
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Mathematical reasoning and basic arithmetic; problem-solving with real-world word problems
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Tone adaptation and style transformation; understanding of register and professional communication norms

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer:
Yes, the answers appear to be both correct and useful. The assistant successfully:
- Explained OOP concepts using relatable analogies (like blueprints and objects) that a beginner could understand
- Provided accurate summaries that captured the essential points without unnecessary details
- Generated a creative and coherent story within the word limit constraints
- Correctly calculated 3 packs of apples (3×4=12) and 3 packs of oranges (3×3=9)
- Appropriately transformed casual text into professional, formal language

The responses demonstrated strong general knowledge capabilities and the ability to adapt to different task types. The math answer was verifiably correct, and the creative and explanatory responses were well-structured and on-topic.

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: "Help me think through the pros and cons of switching from a full-time job to freelance consulting."
   - Result: The assistant provided a well-organized analysis covering financial stability vs. flexibility, benefits considerations, work-life balance implications, and career growth opportunities. It asked clarifying questions about my industry and risk tolerance to personalize the advice.

2. Prompt: "Draft a polite follow-up email to a recruiter who hasn't responded in 2 weeks after my final interview."
   - Result: The assistant generated a professional, warm email that expressed continued interest without being pushy. It included a brief reminder of the position, a polite inquiry about timeline, and offered to provide additional information if needed.

3. Prompt: "What can I cook with chicken, broccoli, garlic, and rice in my fridge?"
   - Result: The assistant suggested several recipes including chicken stir-fry with broccoli and garlic over rice, a one-pan garlic chicken and broccoli bake, and a simple chicken fried rice. Each suggestion included basic cooking steps and estimated prep times.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer:
Yes, the vibes are generally well-aligned. The assistant demonstrates:

**Positive alignment:**
- **Helpful without being overbearing:** It provides actionable advice while leaving room for my own judgment
- **Professional yet approachable tone:** The responses feel conversational but competent
- **Practical focus:** Solutions are grounded in real-world applicability rather than theoretical abstractions
- **Thoughtful structure:** Information is organized logically, making it easy to digest

**Areas for potential improvement:**
- Sometimes responses could be more concise; I prefer brevity when possible
- The assistant could ask more upfront clarifying questions to better tailor responses to my specific situation

Overall, the assistant feels like a knowledgeable collaborator that respects my autonomy while offering valuable input. The tone matches what I'd expect from a helpful colleague.

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
   - Result: The assistant acknowledged it doesn't have access to my calendar or scheduling apps. It offered to help me organize my schedule if I shared my appointments, and suggested calendar integration tools I could explore for future functionality.

2. Prompt: "What's the current weather in San Francisco and should I bring an umbrella today?"
   - Result: The assistant explained it cannot access real-time weather data or APIs. It provided general advice about checking weather apps and mentioned that integrating a weather API would be needed to answer such questions accurately.

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer:
Based on the vibe check, the following limitations were identified:

1. **No real-time data access:** The application cannot fetch current information like weather, news, stock prices, or live events. It's limited to its training data cutoff.

2. **No external integrations:** Cannot connect to personal services like calendars, email, task managers, or other productivity tools that would enable personalized assistance.

3. **No persistent memory:** The assistant doesn't remember previous conversations or learn user preferences over time. Each session starts fresh.

4. **No web browsing capability:** Cannot search the internet, verify current facts, or access URLs for up-to-date information.

5. **No file/document processing:** Cannot read, analyze, or modify documents, spreadsheets, or other files the user might want to work with.

6. **Limited context window:** Very long conversations or documents may exceed the model's context limits, potentially losing important earlier information.

These limitations highlight opportunities for future enhancements through tool integration, RAG systems, or agent-based architectures.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.
