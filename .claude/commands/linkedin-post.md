# LinkedIn Post Generator

Create a professional LinkedIn post from session learnings or completed assignment work.

## Context Sources
- Current session work in AIE09
- Reference implementations in AIE8
- Notes from Obsidian vault

## Instructions

1. **Identify Source Content**:
   - Current session/assignment context
   - Professional value of the learning
   - Industry relevance
   - Personal growth angle

2. **Post Structure** (1300-1500 characters optimal):

   **Opening Hook** (1-2 lines):
   - Professional insight or observation
   - Question that resonates with AI/ML practitioners
   - Counter-intuitive finding

   **Context** (2-3 lines):
   - What you were working on
   - Brief mention of AI Makerspace bootcamp
   - The challenge or problem

   **Key Learnings** (bulk of post):
   - 3-5 bullet points or numbered insights
   - Practical, applicable takeaways
   - Technical depth appropriate for LinkedIn audience

   **Personal Reflection** (2-3 lines):
   - What this means for your work
   - How it changes your approach
   - Connection to broader AI/ML trends

   **Call to Engagement**:
   - Question for the audience
   - Invitation to share experiences

3. **Formatting Guidelines**:
   - Use line breaks between sections (LinkedIn doesn't render markdown)
   - Emojis: professional and minimal (checkmarks, lightbulbs, arrows)
   - No hashtags in body; add 3-5 relevant ones at the end
   - Tag @AI Makerspace
