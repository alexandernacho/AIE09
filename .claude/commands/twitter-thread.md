# Twitter/X Thread Generator

Generate an engaging Twitter thread from session learnings or completed assignment work.

## Context Sources
- Current session work in AIE09
- Reference implementations in AIE8
- Notes from Obsidian vault at `/Users/alexandercoenegrachts/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/obsidian-vault/AIE9`

## Instructions

1. **Identify Source Content**:
   - Current session/assignment being worked on
   - Key concepts learned
   - Code implementations completed
   - Problems solved or insights gained

2. **Thread Structure** (aim for 5-8 tweets):

   **Tweet 1 - Hook**:
   - Attention-grabbing statement or question
   - Mention the topic (e.g., "Advanced RAG retrieval strategies")
   - Include relevant emoji sparingly

   **Tweets 2-6 - Value Bombs**:
   - One key insight per tweet
   - Use numbered lists or bullet points
   - Include code snippets (keep under 280 chars or use images)
   - Add practical examples

   **Tweet 7 - Summary/Takeaway**:
   - Consolidate the main learning
   - Actionable advice

   **Tweet 8 - CTA**:
   - Tag @AIMakerspace
   - Invite engagement (questions, similar experiences)
   - Optional: link to repo or Loom video

3. **Formatting Guidelines**:
   - Each tweet under 280 characters
   - Use line breaks for readability
   - Thread numbering: "1/", "2/", etc.
   - Hashtags: #AIEngineering #LangChain #RAG (max 2-3, last tweet only)

## Output Format

```
1/ [Hook tweet - attention grabbing opening about what you learned]

2/ [First key insight]
